# Controlled string

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LuckyCode7/Controlled-string.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LuckyCode7/Controlled-string)

Write a program to determine if the the parentheses (),
the brackets [], and the braces {}, in a string are balanced.

For example:

{{)(}} is not balanced because ) comes before (

({)} is not balanced because ) is not balanced between {}
and similarly the { is not balanced between ()

[({})] is balanced
{}([]) is balanced
{()}[[{}]] is balanced
